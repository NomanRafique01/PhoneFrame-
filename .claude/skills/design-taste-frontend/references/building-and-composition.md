# Building, Composition & Tokens Reference

### 6. Build it, still

Build the page with motion switched off in your head; a page that needs animation to look finished is
not finished. Order of work:

1. **Tokens.** Colour and type roles from the sheet as CSS custom properties. Everything downstream
   references tokens only. `<skill>/assets/base.css` is a neutral foundation you may start from (reset, token
   names, fluid type steps, grid, focus and selection styles, the motion helpers); it has no look of
   its own.
2. **The hero, exactly as the blueprint describes it,** at desktop and at phone width. Get the big
   thing big and the small things small before anything else exists.
3. **Each section from its blueprint,** with this project's content. Keep the geometry, change the
   subject. Neighbouring sections must not share a layout. **Carry the idea into every section,**
   pricing, FAQ and footer included: the commonest failure in the study, even among good sites, is a
   distinctive first screen followed by stock blocks.
4. **Imagery,** in this order of preference:
   1. the project's own;
   2. generated, if you have an image tool;
   3. **real pictures of the subject's world from the open collections,** whenever an honest one
      exists. Search them with `node <skill>/scripts/assets.mjs "<query>"` (Openverse, Wikimedia
      Commons, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Met; only licences that allow commercial use, by
      default). Search the inventory, not the category: its street in old postcards, an old map of the
      neighbourhood, its material up close, its trade in engravings, a museum object of its kind, a
      botanical plate, a star chart. Use them large and with intent: one archival photograph as the
      hero, an engraving enlarged into the page's motif, the real map of the street as the contact
      section. Look at each before choosing; `--get <ref>` downloads it into `assets/` and records
      its source and licence, and `--credits` prints the credit line for the footer. A found picture
      shows the world around the client and is never presented as the client's own product, room,
      dish, person or team;
   4. **drawn in code from the subject itself,** for what no honest picture exists of (its objects,
      its tiles, its windows, its product's interface, made as one consistent flat graphic language in
      the palette's real colours);
   5. the photographs dealt on the sheet, only where an honestly generic picture fits (the sea for a
      sea house), never as a stand-in for the subject;
   6. type and colour alone.

   When the project has footage or a real picture of its own process or product, the first screen
   shows it, large (about 40% of the screen or more). Never write a sentence on the page about where
   the pictures come from or what they are not ("none of these shows our bar"): a caption says what
   the picture is, and the credit line sits small in the footer. A portfolio whose work is invented
   for the brief draws each piece as a finished still of that work (its title card with its own type,
   an end frame, a poster), with real detail, never as a pictogram of the client's product.

   **The floor, which the inspector checks:** at least four real pictures on the page, usually six to
   twelve (photographs, archival images, maps, engravings, footage, raster artwork; for software, its
   cropped interface fragments count too). SVG drawings do not count toward the floor: draw what no
   picture exists of, and still carry real pictures. Add one moving picture wherever an honest clip
   exists: search it with `assets.mjs --video "<query>"` and use it as a muted loop with a poster
   frame. Models skip pictures and footage because finding them is work; the page fails without them.

   `references/imagery.md` covers searching, licences and credits, video, drawing, crops and treatments.
5. **The live thing** from step 4, built into the section where it proves the claim (often the hero
   or the booking), with real content, a thumb-sized phone version and a plain fallback.
6. **The scroll scenes,** when the sheet deals them (section 9), each with the section it carries: the page's big
   moments, the camera that flies through the work, the picture that opens to the whole screen, the
   word that buckles under the scroll. Copy the shared stage and the scene's files from
   `<skill>/assets/scenes/`, fill the scene with this project's own pictures and words, and set the
   page's tokens so it takes the page's look. A scene is composition: it decides how long the page is
   and what each screen shows, so it is built now and seen in every look round, not added at the end.
   `references/scenes.md` says how to put one on a page, fill it, fit it and check it;
   `assets/scenes/demo/<id>.html` is a working example of each.
7. **Fullness.** Look at each desktop screen as a poster: one dominant thing and the content it
   carries. A screen that is mostly empty ground is an underbuilt section, not a rest; one deliberate
   rest per page is the limit, and the inspector fails a page with two or more near-empty screens.
   Running text is in the full ink at 16px or more; grey is for secondary notes.
8. **The frame.** The page has one pair of equal outer margins at every width, and every section uses
   the width the page has set up: when its text sits in the left half, the right half holds its
   picture, its second column, its list or its figure, never nothing. Asymmetry lives inside the grid,
   never in the frame: a void is placed only when something closes it on the far side. No stretch of
   the page taller than about half a screen holds nothing at all; sections are 120–240px apart on
   desktop. Every section the visitor came for opens with a heading that names it, and the first
   screen carries the page's title in an `h1`. These are what readers name first when a page looks
   wrong ("no clear title", "random empty space", "everything is pushed to one side"), and the
   inspector measures each of them.
9. **States and semantics.** Real links and buttons, visible focus, alt text, a phone layout that is
   its own composition. Every control, the live thing included, works from the keyboard alone in
   reading order and has an accessible name: its visible label, or `aria-label` when it shows only an
   icon.

Read `references/type.md`, `references/colour.md` and `references/layout.md` when you need the detail
behind a decision; the laws below are the short form.
